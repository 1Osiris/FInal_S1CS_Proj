__1 Question:  if any number of randomly ordered integers in an array are sorted both by insertion sort and by mergesort, which sorting routine is faster (and by how much on average)?

Requirements:
The program must accept user input, deciding how big the random number array will be

The program must accept user input deciding how many trials will run.

The output will print the original array(s) and the sorted array(s)

The output will print the average amount of time it took for the merge sort method to sort the array(s) and how long it took the insertion sort method to sort the array(s)

The output will print how much percent faster the faster method is than the other based on the number of trials.

The program will then do the same thing for when 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% percent of the array(s) are already sorted.
